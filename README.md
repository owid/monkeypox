# Monkeypox Data

### Analyzing the data produced by the World Health Organization on the 2022 monkeypox outbreak

Data on the 2022 monkeypox outbreak is collated by the [World Health Organization](https://extranet.who.int/publicemergency/), and is updated as new information is reported.

We fetch the latest version of the WHO data every hour, keep records up to the previous day, apply some transformations (7-day averages, per-capita adjustments, etc.), and produce the `owid-monkeypox-data.csv` file in this repository. This file powers our [Monkeypox Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/monkeypox) on Our World in Data.

### Previous versions of the data

This repository previously relied on data collated by the team at [Global.health](https://www.global.health/). On 23 September 2022, the Global.health team started aggregating data from openly-available data resources (including the WHO) instead of collating data itself. Following this change, we started fetching data directly from the WHO.

> The Global.health team completed a 100 days mission to provide decision makers, researchers, and the public with timely and accurate, openly-accessible, global line-list data for the 2022 monkeypox outbreak. Now, we are at a point of transition. On 2022-09-23, the Global.health team will shift from providing manually-curated line-list data to openly-available data resources, compiling downloadable monkeypox datasets with aggregate case data from the World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Global.health monkeypox line-list data, last updated 2022-09-22, will remain accessible via download through GitHub. We thank our user community for their many helpful contributions and for identifying Global.health as a trusted source of information.â€‹
